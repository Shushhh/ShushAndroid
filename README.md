### About
Silence your phone with any given location or time. 

Has your phone rung when you really needed it to remain silent? During the movies or in a meeting? Don’t worry, Shushhh is the perfect app for you! With our app, your phone will automatically transition between silent and ring when you need it to. You can select a specific location using the Google Maps location services and adjust your radius of silence accordingly. In addition, you can select a defined time constraint and allow the app to repeat across multiple days if needed. But wait, there’s more! You can combine both of the features for the ultimate experience! You can select both location AND time and let the app work its magic. Your phone will no longer be a nuisance, and you can remain worry-free knowing your phone is behaving properly.
